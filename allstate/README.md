Extremely simple program to find out TMEA All-State Orchestra audition result distriution over ISD, region and area. This is for violin instrument only.

Two input files are needed:   
regionmap.csv   
result.csv   

Both can be obtained from TMEA site: https://align.tmea.org/align_2022/index.php.   
result.csv is not commited in repo due to privacy concern, but results for all instrument can be obtained from https://www.tmea.org/all-state/audition-results/
